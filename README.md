# SOLVE STATION LABS AI AGENT WEBINAR

## Overview

This repository contains materials and projects for the Solve Station Labs webinar on building AI-powered applications and intelligent agents using LangChain, LangGraph, and large language models (LLMs). The webinar demonstrates practical implementation patterns for integrating AI capabilities into modern applications.

## What This Webinar Covers

### Core Concepts

- **LangChain Framework**: Understanding the fundamentals of LangChain for building LLM-powered applications
- **LangGraph**: Creating stateful, multi-actor applications with complex workflows modeled as graphs
- **AI Agents**: Building autonomous systems that can perceive, decide, and act to achieve specific goals
- **Prompt Engineering**: Techniques for effective communication with language models
- **Conversation Management**: Implementing context-aware conversational interfaces
- **Agent Orchestration**: Coordinating multiple AI agents to accomplish complex tasks

### Technologies Demonstrated

- Node.js and TypeScript for type-safe development
- Google Gemini AI for language model capabilities
- Express.js for REST API development
- LangGraph for agent workflow management
- PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for data persistence
- Google Cloud services integration (Drive, Calendar)
- Authentication and authorization patterns
- Real-time communication with WebSockets

## Projects Included

### 1. LLM Agent Starter

A foundational project demonstrating basic LangChain concepts including:
- Integration with Google's Gemini AI model
- Simple chain execution for question-answering
- Prompt template usage
- Conversation context management
- Streaming responses for real-time output

This starter project serves as an introduction to building AI-powered applications with minimal complexity.

### 2. Simple LangChain Tutorial

An educational demonstration focusing on core LangChain patterns:
- Prompt engineering techniques
- Chain composition and execution
- Conversational AI assistant implementation
- Memory and context handling
- Streaming response management

Designed for hands-on learning during the webinar sessions.

### 3. Study-Buddy

A comprehensive production-ready application showcasing advanced AI agent implementation:

**Features:**
- Intelligent content simplification using multi-agent architecture
- PDF generation and document processing
- Google Drive integration for file management
- AI-generated study schedules with Google Calendar sync
- Interactive AI tutor chat interface
- Automated quiz generation
- Secure authentication with JWT and Google OAuth
- Swagger API documentation

**Agent Architecture:**
